PawGate is a simple utility designed to prevent accidental keyboard input, particularly when your feline friend decides to grace your workspace.
Currently only supported on **Windows**.

## Attribution

PawGate is a fork of [CatLock](https://github.com/richiehowelll/cat-lock) by [@richiehowelll](https://github.com/richiehowelll). The original project provided the foundation for this utility. This fork adds documentation, testing infrastructure, CI/CD, and a rebrand while maintaining GPL v3 licensing as required.

If you appreciate the original work, please consider [supporting the original author](https://buymeacoffee.com/richiehowelll).

## Features
- Lock your keyboard with a hotkey (Ctrl+L by default)
- Semi-transparent overlay shows keyboard is locked while you monitor your screen
- Unlock by clicking anywhere or pressing the hotkey again
- System tray menu for quick access to settings:
    - Adjust overlay opacity (5% to 90%)
    - Enable/disable lock notifications
- Blocks all 256 keyboard scan codes plus multimedia keys
- Single-instance enforcement (won't run multiple copies)

## Installation

### Option 1: Build Locally (Recommended)

Building locally avoids Windows SmartScreen warnings that can block downloaded executables.

**Easy method** - Just run the build script:
```
build.bat
```

**Manual method:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data="./resources/img/icon.ico;./resources/img/" --add-data="./resources/img/icon.png;./resources/img/" --add-data="./resources/config/config.json;./resources/config/" --icon="./resources/img/icon.ico" --hidden-import plyer.platforms.win.notification --noconsole --name="PawGate" "./src/main.py"
```

The executable will be in the `dist/` folder.

> **Note:** If Windows Defender flags your locally-built exe, add the `dist` folder to Windows Security exclusions.

### Option 2: Download Pre-built Release

Pre-built executables are available on the [Releases](../../releases) page. Note that Windows SmartScreen may warn about unsigned executables from the internet.
## Caveats
- Relies on https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/ which only has full support for Windows
- OS bound hotkeys take precedence such as `ctrl+alt+del` (this way you don't get locked out if something goes wrong)
