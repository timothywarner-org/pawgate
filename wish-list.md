# PawGate Project Wish List

- Fix the "brittleness" of the app's reliance on Python 3.12. That fucked me up for a little while.

- Work around the code signing certificate issue (or get a cert)

- Dial down/turn off audio but keep the help overlay reminding of the current unlock keystroke

- let's not store the keystroke in multiple places; that's bullshit for updates and maintenance

- Perhaps run as a standalone EXE rather than a Setup installer?

- Right-click systray : config with config GUI to adjust opacity and keybinds

- Add an option to start with Windows

- Add an option to lock on screensaver start
